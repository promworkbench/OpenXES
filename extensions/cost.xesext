		The cost extension defines a nested element to store information about the cost associated with activities
		within a log. The objective of this extension is to provide semantics to cost aspects that can be associated with
		events in a log. The definition associates three data elements with a particular cost element: the amount associated
		with the cost element as well as the cost driver that is responsible for incurring that cost and the cost type.
		As it is possible for more than one cost element to be associated with an event, the cost incurred per event is
		summarized using the total attribute. The currency element is also recorded once per event. Cost information
		can be recorded at the trace level (for instance, to be able to say that it costs $20 when a case is started). Cost
		information can also be recorded at the event level (for instance, for certain event types such as complete or
		canceled events) to capture the cost incurred in undertaking the activity by a resource.
